## [6.9.1] Interpret article abstracts

*Day Care Centers and Respiratory Health [@Nafstad1999]*

**Objective.** To estimate the effects of the type of day care on respiratory health in preschool children.

**Methods.** A population-based cross-sectional study of Oslo children born in 1992 was conducted at the end of 1996. A self-administered questionnaire inquired about day care arrangements, environmental conditions, and family characteristics (n = 3853; response rate, 79%).

**Results.** In a logistic regression controlling for confounding, children in day care centers had more often nightly cough (adjusted odds ratio, 1.89; 95%), and blocked or runny nose without common cold (1.55; 1.07, 1.61) during the past 12 months compared with children in home care.

**Construct a table and calculate the corresponding odds and odds ratios. Comment on the reported and calculated results.**

## [6.9.2.1] Soccer goals on target

*Data from an article in Psychological Science, July 2011. [@Masters2007]*

The example in the text referred to all shots, good or bad. This data relates to shots on target, 18 out of 20 shots were scored when the goalkeeper’s team was behind, 71 out of 90 shots were scored when the game was tied, and when the team was not behind 55 out of 75 shots were scored. Calculate the odds of scoring for games behind, games tied, and games not behind. Construct empirical odds ratio for scoring for behind versus tied and tied versus not behind.

+ Fit a model with the categorical predictor c(“behind”,“tied”,“not behind”) and interpret the exponeniated coefficients. How do they compare to the empirical odds ratios you calculated?
+ Would it be better to model this data using a negative binomial variable? Explain.
